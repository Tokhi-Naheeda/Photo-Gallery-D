# My First Project (Photo Gallery)
Hi. I've created a Photo Gallery as my first project.
## What to see and learn here:
- Create a transparent background image.
- Add FontAwesome icons with a **Pulse Grow** hover effect
- A Photo Gallery with a text **overlay** over images.
- Text shadows/ box shadows and animations.
- @Keyframes
- Google Fonts

## Image with:
- <img src="./images/html.jpg" width="100" height="50">
- <img src="./images/css.png" width="100" height="50">
## Setup:
1. Copy the repository to your computer.
2. Copy the SSH (git@github.com:NaheedaTokhi/Photo-Gallery-NaheedaTokhi.git)
3. Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the Photo Gallery.
4. To customize the gallery, edit the HTML and CSS file to your liking. You can add or remove images, adjust styles, and change the layout as needed
